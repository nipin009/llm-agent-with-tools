# LLM Agent with Tools

This repository demonstrates the creation of a Language Learning Model (LLM) agent using LangChain and multiple external tools for real-time information retrieval and research. The agent integrates the OpenAI API and uses the following tools for web search, Wikipedia search, and academic research:

- **DuckDuckGo Search**: Real-time web search for quick information.
- **Wikipedia Search**: Provides factual information from Wikipedia.
- **Arxiv Search**: Retrieves academic papers and research articles by keywords, topics, or authors.

## Technologies Used
- **LangChain**: A framework for building language models with integrated tools.
- **OpenAI API**: For working with LLMs.
- **DuckDuckGo API**: For searching the web.
- **Wikipedia API**: For retrieving information from Wikipedia.
- **Arxiv API**: For finding academic papers and articles.

## Setup

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenAI API key
- LangChain library
- DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, and Arxiv API access (optional)
